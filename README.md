# Exploring with Dad

*Father and Son Experiments in Science and Biology - Created in 2025*

## Description
This folder contains different projects that parents can complete with their children to learn more about the scientific process, observation, writing and communication, and the natural world around us. Each project includes a letter that the parent can send to the child to explain the experiment, a list of supplies with an estimated costs list, care sheets or guides to explain each step of the process, an observation guide, and a glossary of key words to help develop vocabulary.

As of today, this project is a work in progress. As this project unfolds, additional materials in the Spanish language will be added.

## About Me
My name is Andrew Wright and I have a son with autism. 

I have been intrigued by science since elementary school; it was always my favorite subject. Going through the different grade levels, I was fascinated by different experiments we did in class: watching caterpillars turn into butterflies, watching tadpoles turn into frogs, growing plants, collecting insects, and dissecting small animals to name a few.

I became interested in physical sciences in high school, taking classes such as chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology. At the time, I was dreaming of pursing a career in medicine. With that goal, I attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in exercise science. I then continued my education at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio where I completed a master's degree in medical physiology. I also studied and became interested in aerospace physiology at the time. Now, most of my time is spent studying and learning about different topics in aerospace physiology, including hypoxia, acceleration, spatial disorientation, and circadian rhythms. I enjoy studying both combat pilots and astronauts.

My son, Oliver, was born between my first and second year of grad school. As he grew, I had a deep desire to share my joy for science with him. I reflected on the different projects and experiments I completed in school when I was close to his age. 

Initially, I wrote letters to him explaining the different projects I wanted to complete with him. As I put more thought into what I was doing, I turned the letters into a complete guide for the project. I thought this would 1) introduce him to letter writing, 2) give him a good foundation for the scientific process, and 3) help keep the project on track as we completed it step by step.

As I compiled the project documents, I began to think about how great it would be to share these projects with other fathers who want to have a better connection with their children. That is where the idea of this repository was born. What started out a one or two experiments has grown into a complete list of different projects that help us learn about science and nature alongside our children.

These projects were designed to be engaging and hands-on, helping children explore science in a structured, enjoyable way. By observing animals, recording data, and conducting experiments, children develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and observation skills. The letter format also encourages reading, writing, and communications, giving children a safe and predictable way to express their thoughts and ideas. Above all, I hope these projects will bring fathers closer to their children.

For children with autism, these activities provide additional benefits. They support focus, patience, and emotional regulation while fostering curiosity and intrinsic motivation. Following step-by-step instructions and caring for living things helps build responsibility, sequencing skills, and confidence, all within a motivating, sensory-rich learning environment.

Overall, the projects combine science, literacy, and personal growth, providing opportunities for meaningful learning and connection between parents and children. They are designed to be shared and adapted so other families can enjoy the same experiences and developmental benefits.

I sincerely hope you enjoy completing these projects along with your little ones.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is designed to make it easy for parents, guardians, or caregivers to guide children through a series of hand-on science projects and experiments. Think of this repo as a toolkit of letters, guides, and activity instruction that you can adapt for your child.

Here’s a suggested way to use the materials:
1.	**Print the letters and guides** - Each project includes a generic letter written to a child and a detailed guide. Parents can choose to use the provided letter or write a more personalized letter of their own. Additionally, you may choose to print the guides or simply keep them digital.
2.	**Send the project to your child** - Printing and mailing the letters and project guides to your child can make the experience extra special – the child receives a personal package in the male and feels like a real scientist embarking on a project.
3.	**Gather the supplies** - Each project includes a materials list. Parents can shop for supplies locally, or in the future, a curated list with Amazon links or QR codes may be provided to simplify the process.
4.	**Complete the projects** - Projects are designed to build on each other, but they can also be completed in any order. Follow the guides, experiment, explore, and most importantly, have fun!
5.	**Encourage exploration and learning** - The goal of these projects is curiosity, creativity, and hands-on learning. Each project includes learning objectives and reflection prompts to help your child think critically and enjoy the scientific process.

## Support
The best way for you to support me with this project is to try out these experiments with your little ones and document their fun and enthusiasm for learning.

Additionally, should you feel so inclined to buy me a coffee, that would also be much appreciated.
